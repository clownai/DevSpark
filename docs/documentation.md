- Terminal command execution

## Architecture

DevSpark IDE follows a client-server architecture:

### Frontend
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript-based UI
- Monaco Editor for code editing
- Service-based component architecture
- Event-driven communication between components

### Backend
- Node.js/Express server
- RESTful API endpoints
- File system integration
- Git command execution
- Deployment process management

## Components

### Services
- `api-service.js`: Handles communication with the backend API
- `ai-service.js`: Manages AI integration features
- `git-service.js`: Handles Git operations
- `deployment-service.js`: Manages deployment functionality
- `scaffolding-service.js`: Handles application scaffolding

### UI Components
- `ai-integration-ui.js`: UI for AI features
- `git-integration-ui.js`: UI for Git features
- `deployment-ui.js`: UI for deployment features
- `scaffolding-ui.js`: UI for application scaffolding

### Backend
- `server.js`: Express server with API endpoints
